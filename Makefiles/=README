Package-framework provides a lot of useful makefiles for general
purpose applications, as well as a few special purpose ones (e.g. for
building Systas Scheme).  However, to accomodate for Scheme 48's
module system, we need a few new special purpose Makefile snippets.

To avoid the troubles of maintaining a branch of package-framework as
well, this directory will act as a staging ground while Makefiles are
written, generalized, and made suitable for inclusion in
package-framework.
