To make kali, follow the instructions in INSTALL.  It has to be
installed some where in your PATH.  (Before you do a
   make install
you can try it out by running the `go' file in the source directory.)

Documentation on using Kali can be found in doc/kali.{ps|html}.

If you have problems building or using Kali, please send mail to
   kali-request@research.nj.nec.com
